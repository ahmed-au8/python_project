# python_project

For the python project I decided to write a script for a To Do list Manager, where users can add, remove and complete tasks

I used sqlite3 to create and manipulate the database

I created functions to add, remove, complete, and list task based on users input

I used regex to validate the input from the user

Argus was used to store command line inputs

Note: I enjoyed this class and every lab was useful. However, Python sql is the most interesting and it is my favorite lab in this course
